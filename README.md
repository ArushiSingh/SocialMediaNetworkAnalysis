# SocialMediaNetworkAnalysis
The project aims to perform analysis on social media ad networks using machine learning techniques. The objective is to gain insights into the effectiveness, targeting, and impact of ad campaigns on social media platforms. By analyzing the ad network, we can identify patterns, optimize ad strategies, and improve ad performance.
**# Data Collection**
The data has been collected from Kaggle. The dataset used in this project provides information on whether individuals of a specific age and income level make purchases of a particular product. Our objective is to predict whether a specific audience targeted will make a purchase of the product or not.
**# DataPreprocessing**
Cleaned and preprocessed the collected data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing formats. In this project, performed the proper EDA to the dataset.
**# Feature Engineering**
Extracted meaningful features from the ad network data to facilitate analysis. Also, performed Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate analyses.
**# Normalising Datasets**
Normalised the data using Standard Scaler.
**# Train and Test**
Split the dataset into training and testing datasets. 
**# Modeling**
Used various machine learning models for prediction such as Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, and Naive Bayes and compared the performance of each model.
